### Development

To start a development server on `9966` that will watch for code changes simply run:

```
$ npm start
```

To optimize the output for production, run:

```
$ npm run build
``

If you'd like to host in production, you'll need to setup [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) 
and run the following commands which will use AppEngine to deploy it on cloud. 
```
$ gcloud app deploy
```
